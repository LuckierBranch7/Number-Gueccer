# Number Gueccer
***The game made in C***

No, it's not a typo. I could've gone with a bland Number Guesser, but I want to make people see that the game is in C. As always, it is currently a terminal game (as of v1.x). I intend on adding a GUI later, but that's later! You need a C/C++ compiler installed on your computer (like GCC or Clang) in order to run this script. And yeah, I love yet hate C, and use C++ instead!
